EXERCISE 2: 6) Satellite Command System Programming Exercise

Satellite Command System simulates controlling a satellite in orbit. The satellite starts in a default initial state and can accept a series of commands to change its orientation, solar panel status, and data collection.

Classes:

ActivatePanelsCommand

CollectDataCommand

DeactivatePanelsCommand

RotateCommand

SatelliteCommandSystem uses Invoker (Command Pattern)

Satellite uses Receiver (Command Pattern)

Interface:

Command

Pattern Used:

Features

Orientation

Activate and Deactivate Panels

Collectdata
Orientation( rotate(South) would set the orientation to "South")
