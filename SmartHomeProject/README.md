# üè† Smart Home System

## Overview
This is a console-based Java application that simulates a **Smart Home System**.  
It allows users to control and monitor smart devices such as **lights, thermostats, and door locks** via a centralized hub.  
The system supports **scheduling, automation triggers, remote access, and device state management**, while applying multiple **design patterns** to ensure modularity and maintainability.

---

## Features
- Initialize and manage multiple devices with unique IDs and types.
- Turn devices **ON/OFF** or change device-specific settings (e.g., thermostat temperature).
- Schedule devices to perform actions at specific times.
- Automate tasks based on triggers (e.g., turn off lights when temperature exceeds a threshold).
- Add or remove devices dynamically.
- Monitor device status in real-time.
- Extend device behavior dynamically using decorators (e.g., energy monitoring).
- Integrate legacy devices seamlessly using adapters.
- Centralized hub (singleton) manages all communication between devices.

## Design Patterns Used

| Pattern Type       | Pattern Name           | How Used                                                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Creational**    | Factory Method        | Dynamically create devices without modifying hub code.                  |
|                   | Singleton             | `SmartHomeHub` ensures only one hub instance exists.                   |
| **Structural**    | Proxy                 | Adds authentication and logging for device access.                      |
|                   | Adapter               | Integrates legacy devices with the system.                              |
|                   | Decorator             | Extends device functionality dynamically (e.g., energy monitoring).     |
| **Behavioral**    | Command               | Encapsulates actions (ON/OFF, set temperature) and decouples from UI.  |
|                   | State                 | Handles device states (ON/OFF, LOCKED/UNLOCKED).                        |
|                   | Observer              | Devices or automation engine react to events/triggers automatically.    |
|                   | Mediator              | `SmartHomeHub` coordinates communication between all devices.           |
